With their ability to forecast preferences based on vast user histories, recommendation systems are essential to current services. Using the Amazon reviews dataset, this study examines the efficacy of classical machine learning (ML) models, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in e-commerce suggestions. Sophisticated methods like collaborative filtering are investigated to improve suggestion precision. We evaluate these models' performance and compare their accuracies through extensive testing to determine which model is best for forecasting user behavior and enhancing the quality of recommendations. Comprehensive research and significant insights into the efficacy of recommendation systems are made possible by utilizing the extensive user input and preferences included in the Amazon reviews dataset. Our results aid in the e-commerce industry's recommendation system optimization by providing helpful advice on which.
 we have also used the user-based collaborative filtering technique for this recommendation system.
